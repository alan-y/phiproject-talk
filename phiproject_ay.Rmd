## The R code to create phiproject

Mostly very [simple](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/phiproject/blob/master/R/phiproject.R)

- `dir.create()`
- `writeLines()`
- [dcf file](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/phiproject/blob/master/inst/rstudio/templates/project/phiproject.dcf) to interact with RStudio

## Demo

1. Create new project with phiproject template
2. New features
3. RMarkdown templates
4. RStudio 1.2 vs RStudio < 1.2


## Planned Developments

Polishing up:

- Vignettes for RMarkdown templates
- Unit tests, code coverage, etc
- Continuous integration with Travis

Additional features/templates:

- ioslides template
- shiny template
- Leaflet template for making maps
- More stats templates
- Updating MS Word templates with [flextable](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable)
